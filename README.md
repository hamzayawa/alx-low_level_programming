## Data Structures & Algorithms

A low-level programming language is one whose commands or functions closely resemble processor instructions and which offers little to no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture.
Typically, either machine code or assembly language is meant.
Low-level languages are sometimes referred to as being "near to the hardware" because of the minimal or nonexistent degree of abstraction between them and machine language.
Low-level language programs are typically not very portable.
