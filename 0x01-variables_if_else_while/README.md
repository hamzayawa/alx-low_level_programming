# - TASK 

[0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/hamzayawa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.


[1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/hamzayawa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c) - This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.


[2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/hamzayawa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c) - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.


[3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/hamzayawa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c) - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.


[4-print_alphabt](https://github.com/hamzayawa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c) - Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

[5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/hamzayawa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c) - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

[6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/hamzayawa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c) - Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

[7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/hamzayawa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c) - Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. 

[8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/hamzayawa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c) - Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

[9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/hamzayawa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c) - Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. 

[100-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/hamzayawa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c) - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits numbers separated by comma.

[101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/hamzayawa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c) - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits numbers separated by comma.


[102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/hamzayawa/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c) - Write a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
